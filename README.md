# Next.js 15 Server Component Circular Dependency

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Next.js 15's server components: issues arising from circular or deeply nested dependencies.

## Problem
When a server component directly or indirectly imports itself, the application might fall into an infinite loop during rendering, or data might be unexpectedly missing.

## Solution
Refactor the code to break the circular dependency.  This usually involves restructuring your data fetching logic and component architecture to avoid cyclical imports.  Consider using a different approach, such as separating data fetching into independent modules or utilizing Context API for data sharing.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error in the browser console or the application's behavior.
